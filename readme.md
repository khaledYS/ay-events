# Warning
This project is old and specially when I was trying to learn and the explore the beauty of programming.
nevertheless, This projects contains old code and bad was to acheive things or solve problems, this shouldn't 
be taken. At somepoint I decided to delete this repo, but guess what? everbody starts somewhere and I must let 
the world see that I was at the pretty far down beginning.
This Project was designed to be a click eventer that does something to button when certain events happen, guess what?
It is amazingly great considering my limits at that time. Again this Code is a bad practice of code. NEVER USE THIS.
